### Project Overview
 This sales pereformance analysis provides an in-depth examination of a retail store's sales trends, identfying areas of strength and opportunities for growth. the analysis covers time period, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales revenue, product category performance, customer demographics, and geographical sales distribution.

### Data sources
To support the objectives and scope of this analysis, the following data sources will be utilized. this was research was literaily based on internal sources which includes, point of sales data system, sales invoices and receipts, customer relationship management sogtware, sales team reports and feedbacks and customer transaction data.

### Tools Used
the tools used for this project are;
- Microsoft excel for data cleaning
- SQL for query writing
- Powerbi for visualization and 
- Github for documentation

 ### Data cleaning
  data cleaning involves several processes. to ensure data accuracy, completeness and consistency, here is a step-by-step process.
- handling missing files
  1. identify missing values (e.g, NULL, blank, NA).
  2. decide on replacement stategies (e.g,  mean, median, imputation).
  3. replace missing values
- data normalization
  1. standardize date formats
  2. convert categorical variables into numerical variables
- error detection and correction
  1. identify errors
  2. correct errors manually or using algorithms
  3. verify corrections

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
EDA involves examining and summarizing data to understand patterns, trends and corrections. here is a comprehensive EDA checklist.
 -  what are the top-selling products/category
 -  which regions/territories generate most most sales
 -  how do sales vary by season/holiday
 -  which customer segments drive most sales
 -  what marketing channels are most effective

### Data analysis
As an analytist, you cleaan your data and prepare it for presentation.
with microsoft excel, i'm going to do an exploration of the sales performance data for a clearer and understandable presentation.

 ### EXCEL
  1.   Here, i'm going to perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Using pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region and month

![Screenshot (56)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d3c0dd9-c3fb-4cb1-83ed-dad3488ff70e)

The pivot table above shows the total number of sales generated by each products showing product with the highest sales and lowest sales

![total sales by region](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e919e4a-02ee-49be-96ca-67ba01d9c648)

The above pivot table shows the total number of sales generated by each region.


![total sales by  month](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2b8969b-123b-4acb-9c4b-087b67869c42)


   This pivot table above explains the total no of sales by month 

2.  Here, i'm going to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region using excel formulas.

![average sales](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79c3c033-ab97-444d-bcf4-e2063b5a9250)

The picture above explained the average sales per product using the excel formulas.
The formulas are;

-  GLOVES: =AVERAGIF(C:C, "GLOVES", H:H)
-  HAT:  =AVERAGIF(C:C,"HAT", H:H)
- JACKET: =AVERAGIF(C:C, "JACKET", H:H)
- SHIRT: =AVERAGIF(C:C,"SHIRT" H:H)
- SHOES: AVERAGIF(C:C, "SHOES", H:H)
- SOCKS: AVERAGIF(C:C, "SOCKS", H:H)


![TOTAL REVENUE BY REGION](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/979ba96a-c2d7-473b-a00d-ee3304f09fae)

The above picture explained the total revenue by each region using excel formulas
the formulas are;

- NORTH: =SUMIF(D:D, "NORTH", H:H)
- SOUTH: =SUMIF(D:D, "SOUTH", H:H)
- WEST: =SUMIF(D:D, "WEST", H:H)
- EAST: =SUMIF(D:D, "EAST", H:H)



3.  here, i will calcualte the percentage of total sales generated by each region using pivot table

This explains the percentage of total sales generated by each region.



### SQL (STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE)

Here, i'm going to be writing some queries to extract key insights based on the following questions.

1. retrieve the total sales for each product category.

     ```SQL
   
       SELECT product, sum(total_sales) AS total
       FROM [dbo].[Sales Data)
       GROUP BY
       product
       ORDER BY
       SUM(total_sales) DESC.
        ```

2.  Find the number of sales transactions in each region

     ```SQL
       SELECT region, COUNT(OrderID) AS number_of_sales_transactions
       FROM [dbo].[sales data]
       GROUP BY
       Region
       ```

3.  Find the highest selling product by total sales

     ```SQL
        SELECT TOP 1 product, SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales_value
        FROM [dbo].[sales data]
        GROUP BY
        product
        ORDER BY
        total_ sales_ value DESC
      ```

4.  Calculate total revenue per product

     ```SQL
        SELECT product, SUM(total_sales) AS total revenue
        FROM [dbo].[sales data]
        GROUP BY
        product
     ```

5   Calculate monthly sales totals for the current year


  ```SQL
    select DATENAME(MONTH, Orderdate) AS month,
  sum(total_sales) AS monthly_sales_total
  from [dbo].[sales data]
  where OrderDate >= DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(GETDATE()), 1, 1)
   AND
  OrderDate < DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(GETDATE()) +1, 1, 1)
   GROUP BY DATENAME(MONTH, OrderDate)
  order by month
  ```

6.  Find the top 5 customers by total purchaseamount.

     ```SQL
        SELECT TOP 5 CustomerID, SUM(Total_sales) AS total_purchase_amount
         FROM [dbo].[sales data]
         GROUP BY
         CustomerID
         OREDR BY
         Total_purchase_amount DESC
      ```
     

7.  Caluculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region

     ```SQL
        SELECT Region, SUM(tptal_sales) AS total sales
        ROUND(SUM(total_sales)/ SELECT SUM(total_sales)
        FROM [dbo].[sales data]) * 100,2) AS percentage_of-total_sales
        FROM [dbo].[sales date]
        GROUP BY
        region
        ORDER BY
        total sales DESC
       ```


8. Identify products with no sales in the last quater

    ```SQL
       SELECT product FROM [dbo].[sales data]
       WHERE
       product NOT IN (SELECT product FROM [dbo].[sales data]
       WHERE
       orderdate >= DATEADD(QUATER, -1, GETDATE())).
      ```


   ### POWER BI

   Here, i'm a going to create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in excel and SQL. The dashboard should indicate a sales overview, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns.

    ### Sales OverView

   ![sales overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e53f1652-9e7f-405b-ac68-128cebe96bbf)


   This picture above explains the sales overview of the retail store, showing the amount of total no of sales and the sum of total sales in each year.


   ### Top-Performing Products


   ![top performing products](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/317be6f1-4228-4d21-8ba5-e891c741d184)

   This pictture above explains the top performing products and the table explaining the details in the bar chart with product that has the highest value.


   ### Regional breakdowns


   ![regional breakdowns](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b709b2a1-f820-45d3-8523-82f21cba2a2e)

   The picture explains the reional breakdowns of the sales with a table showing the details in the bar chart.

     In conclusion, based on the sales analysis of the retail, it has revealed valuable insights into the store's performance. the summaries provided have helped identify:
   -  total sales and average order value
   -  best selling regions and products
   -  sales trends by month
