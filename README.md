- handling missing files
  1. identify missing values (e.g, NULL, blank, NA).
  2. decide on replacement stategies (e.g,  mean, median, imputation).
  3. replace missing values
- data normalization
  1. standardize date formats
  2. convert categorical variables into numerical variables
- error detection and correction
  1. identify errors
  2. correct errors manually or using algorithms
  3. verify corrections
- data transformation
  1. aggregate data (e.g, group by, pivot)
  2. merge datasets
  3. transpose data
-data validation

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
EDA involves examining and summarizing data to understand patterns, trends and corrections. here is a comprehensive EDA checklist.
 -  what are the top-selling products/category
 -  which regions/territories generate most most sales
 -  how do sales vary by season/holiday
 -  which customer segments drive most sales
